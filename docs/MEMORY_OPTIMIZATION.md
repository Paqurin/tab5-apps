## Performance Benefits
1. **Smoother HD Rendering**: Large buffers eliminate frame drops
2. **Better Multitasking**: More memory allows concurrent app execution
3. **Enhanced Media Support**: Large file buffers for camera/video operations
4. **Improved Responsiveness**: Reduced memory pressure and better caching

## Memory Usage Guidelines
- Use PSRAM for large buffers and graphics operations
- Keep critical code and small data in internal SRAM
- Utilize DMA for efficient PSRAM transfers
- Monitor memory usage to prevent fragmentation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify PSRAM initialization at startup
2. Test memory allocation under load
3. Monitor for memory leaks during extended operation
4. Benchmark display performance with new buffer sizes
